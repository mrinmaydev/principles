# Greetings!

I am so much in amusement to welcome you to my static, virtual representative of mine, “Principles”. (The domain reads different -"Principles by M dev" because principles.info was, unfortunately, already taken 😞)

I am Mrinmay Dev Sarma, a 15.8 yo high schooler 🎒, an introvert and an overthinker who mostly prefer words ✏ to voice 🎤

But this is in no way enough to describe me!(no pun intended)

I shall list some of my obsessions and dislikes, which can, at least to an extent, illustrate my personality:

_My Obsessions_ -

-   Note-taking 📖 (Not linear! I'll come into this with a separate article, or should be up already by the time you are reading this)
    
-   Planning my day 🌱
    
-   Linux and Open source🐧
    
-   Web 3.0🌏 (the page you're on right now, is indeed deployed on the web 3!)
    
-   Stationary goodies 😍😍
    
-   Learning effective ways to learn 📚
    
-   Creating relational knowledge base  🕸 (Could not come up with a better name! I will soon write a post on this, or should be up already by the time you are reading this)
    
-   The human brain 🧠
    
-   Teaching👨🏫 (the most perplexing skill to learn according to me)
    
-   Designing (UX) 🎨
    
-   Classical acoustic guitar 🎸(totally self-taught)
    
-   Tinkering with big data 📊 and (still in progress, but I am more than willing to share what I've learned so far!)
    
-   Of course! Writing 🖊️
 📖
    

_My Dislikes_ -

-   Meta(the then Facebook) and its products (disparity caused among the millennial population)
    
-   Knowledge isolation (practiced by so many people)
    
-   Socializing(totally, not a good habit to flex on. But, I wish to improve)
    
-   The education sphere in India
    
-   Passive learning
    
-   Partying.
    

By now, you should hopefully be able to draw a rough sketch of mine.

But you have come here for a reason, haven't you? So, I want to make sure you know what you're surfing.

Principles is a portfolio website of mine🙂, which is also one of my dream projects - a static site deployed on the Internet Computer(or, more intuitively, the WEB 3.0) with a major contributor being Dfinity(I assure you to make a separate article on this subject, and hopefully it is up already by the time you're reading this). Here are few things I wish to deliver to my viewers through Principles -

-   My principles framed around this world as a teenager.
    
-   Showcase my skills and expertise on various disciplines.
    
-   Make people familiar with the concept of "openness".
    
-   Share some effective ways of learning.
    
-   My comprehension of the GIGANTIC term "Education".
    

And there you have it. Hopefully, you are not confused : )

As a final note, thank you for reading and have a great day! 🌟
